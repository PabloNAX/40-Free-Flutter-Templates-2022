The template is easy to customize, you can change the objects as you require. Also, the template is created in a dark and light style, which has become the most relevant recently among all applications.

After long holidays or just some failures, it is always difficult to start active work. There are several motivational theories to beat procrastination, but I believe that the most effective solution is the user-friendly Task Planner App.

With this app, it’s possible to view, schedule and manage tasks as well as see projects that are being worked on. The nice color palette of this design perfectly copes with its task-it pleases the eye, but does not distract from the really important things.

Be careful, this is only a design. No backend.

Useful reading (reading good books) expands a person's horizons, enriches his inner world, makes him smarter and has a positive effect on memory. Reading books increases a person's vocabulary, contributes to the development of clearer thinking, which allows you to formulate and express thoughts more lucidly. It also has a great effect on the sense of humor, which in the modern world is put on a par with the ability to communicate.

So, that's why, applications for reading books are most relevant in today's reading society. Apps like Apple Books, Amazon Kindle, or Bookmate have been on the market for a long time and show excellent results. This template is in no way less than the book giants.

Everything brilliant is quite simple. Like this template. There is nothing superfluous in the interface. Books are downloaded from public domain sources. Users of the app can read online or download books to use the app, for example, in flight. The app also has a dark mode to make it easier to read at night.
